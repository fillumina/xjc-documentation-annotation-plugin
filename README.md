Note to fillumina's version 2.0+:
=================================

Mavenized, refactored and fixed some bugs related to empty entities. A simple java test suite
has been added too.

XJC plugin to bring XSD descriptions into annotations of generated classes
==========================================================================

[Habr article](https://habr.com/en/post/437914/) (in Russian) describing for what it and how to use.


Why that plugin born you may find at the end of readme, but now lets look what it does and how to use it!

## What it does: \<annotation>\<documentation> -> Java class annotations

Said we have this object described in XSD:

```xml
  <xs:complexType name="Customer">
    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>Пользователь</xs:documentation>
      </xs:annotation>
    <xs:sequence>
      <xs:element name="name" type="xs:string">
        <xs:annotation>
          <xs:documentation>Фамилия и имя</xs:documentation>
        </xs:annotation>
      </xs:element>
    </xs:sequence>
  </xs:complexType>
```

We run xjc like:

    xjc -npa -no-header -d src/main/generated-java/ -p xsd.generated scheme.xsd

And got class like (getters, setters and any annotations omitted for simplicity):

```java
public class Customer {
  @XmlElement(required = true)
  protected String name;
}
```

**But in my case I want known how to class and fields was named in source file!**
So it what this plugin do!

So you get:

```java
@XsdInfo(name = "Пользователь", xsdElementPart = "<complexType name=\"Customer\">\n  <complexContent>\n    <restriction base=\"{http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema}anyType\">\n      <sequence>\n        <element name=\"name\" type=\"{http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema}string\"/>\n      </sequence>\n    </restriction>\n  </complexContent>\n</complexType>")
public class Customer {

    @XmlElement(required = true)
    @XsdInfo(name = "Фамилия и имя")
    protected String name;
}
```

## How to use

### Manual call in commandline
If you want run it manually ensure jar class with plugin in run classpath and just add option `-XPluginDescriptionAnnotation`. F.e.:

    xjc -npa -no-header -d src/main/generated-java/ -p xsd.generated -XPluginDescriptionAnnotation scheme.xsd

### Call from Java/Groovy
```groovy
  Driver.run(
    [
       '-XPluginDescriptionAnnotation'
        ,'-d', generatedClassesDir.absolutePath
        ,'-p', 'info.hubbitus.generated.test'
        ,'Example.xsd'
    ] as String[]
    ,new XJCListener() {...}
  )
```

See test [XJCPluginDescriptionAnnotationTest](src/test/groovy/info/hubbitus/XJCPluginDescriptionAnnotationTest.groovy) for example.

### Use from Gradle

With [gradle-xjc-plugin](https://github.com/unbroken-dome/gradle-xjc-plugin):

```gradle
plugins {
  id 'java'
  id 'org.unbroken-dome.xjc' version '1.4.1' // https://github.com/unbroken-dome/gradle-xjc-plugin
}

...

dependencies {
  xjcClasspath 'info.hubbitus:xjc-documentation-annotation-plugin:1.0'
}

// Results by default in `build/xjc/generated-sources`
xjcGenerate {
  source = fileTree('src/main/resources') { include '*.xsd' }
  packageLevelAnnotations = false
  targetPackage = 'info.hubbitus.xjc.plugin.example'
  extraArgs = [ '-XPluginDescriptionAnnotation' ]
}
```
Just run:

    ./gradlew xjcGenerate

Please look complete example in [example-project-gradle](example-project-gradle) directory - it have fully independent gradle project ot demonstrate how to use this plugin..

## Development:

Build:

    ./gradlew jar

Run tests:

    ./gradlew test

## Rationale (why it is born)
For our integration we have task load big amount of `XSD` files into `MDM` software (proprietary [Unidata](https://unidata-platform.com/)).

`XJC` is good tool for generate Java `DTO` classes from `XSD` specification. It was first part ow way.
Then I got excellent [reflections](https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections) library and travers generated classes.

Problem was I was not be able name my model items with original annotations! Despite `XJC` place initial Javadoc which contains description and related part of `XML` element it have several problems:

1. That only for class, and absent fo fields.
2. Even for class I can't use javadoc in runtime

First approach to parse `XSD` for documentation on groovy works, but was very fragile and always require get updates and hacks.

I long time search way to bring such annotations into `DTO` classes itself to do not do work twice (generate classes and again parse `XSD` files manually).
I did not found solution. And it is the reason born of that plugin.
